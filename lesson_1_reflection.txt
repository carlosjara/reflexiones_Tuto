How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

When you've created your document, written down your thoughts, and saved the file, click "Next" to learn about some systems that can help you create these versions of your files.
Like Sarah said, there is a lot of research out there on reflection. If you want a quick intro with some neat graphics, check out this site.

When you've updated your document, click "Next" and Sarah will go over another difference between version control systems.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because with the differents commits you can see the evolution of the files, and you can find some mistakes in the files more easily

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To to view the history of the commits line you can use git log (or you can use git log --stat too this command you can see the complete infomration of the commit) to see the commits on the time line and can copy the IDs to compare two differents commits with git diff IDfirst IDsecond.

could break something?
